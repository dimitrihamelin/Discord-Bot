## ⚙️ Setup Commands

Prepare to forge your Discord bot environment by executing the following commands in the terminal of Visual Studio Code:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install discord.js@latest
npm install croxydb
brew install ffmpeg (mac os)
sudo apt-get update (ubuntu & debian)
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg (ubuton & debian)
brew install ffmpeg
npm install prism-media
npm i sodium
```
**1. Replace by your files (main.js)**

```bash

require('dotenv').config();
const FFmpeg = require('/Users/dimitrihamelin/github/Bot-Discord/node_modules/prism-media/src/core/FFmpeg.js'); // Adjust the path accordingly

client.login(Token).then(console.log("Support FR qui marche")).catch((err) => {console.log("Problème FR")}) //here

let eventFiles = readdirSync('/Users/dimitrihamelin/github/Bot-Discord/fr/croxydb').filter(file => file.endsWith('.js')); //here

for (let file of eventFiles) {
	let event = require(`/Users/dimitrihamelin/github/Bot-Discord/fr/croxydb/${file}`); //here
	if (event.once) {
		client.once(event.name, (...args) => event.execute(...args));
	} else {
		client.on(event.name, (...args) => event.execute(...args));
	}
}

```

**2. Modify your file config.json** 

```bash

{
"Channel":"",
"roleStaff":"",
"log":"",
"rolebot": "", 
"welcome":"",
"farewell": "",
"SERVER": "", 
"STATUS": "",
"LIVE": "", 
"Token": "",
"prefix": "!" 
}

```

**3. Modify your file main.js for every number** 

```bash
			  client.on('ready', () => {
				setInterval(() => {
				  const serverOne = client.guilds.cache.get('834895609622167592');
				  const channelOne = serverOne.channels.cache.get('1128741348095295648');
				  channelOne.setName(`📊｜Membres - ` + serverOne.memberCount, 'AutoMemberCount')
				}, 10000);
			  })

			  const clientId = '1132431328328036442';
			  const guildId = '834895609622167592';

const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken('Your Token');

```


Warning : Replace also the path and "your token" in the main page & config.

Sodium or the others issues on the console can work.

**Download all the dependencies listed in the console. Launch with Ready.js or main.js.**
